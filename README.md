Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a person is diabetic based on health data.
I used two supervised classification algorithms: Random Forest Classifier and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
After training and evaluating both models, the Random Forest Classifier gave the best accuracy.
The dataset was sourced from YBI Foundation and includes features like glucose level, BMI, age, and blood pressure.
Future improvements include hyperparameter tuning and model deployment.
